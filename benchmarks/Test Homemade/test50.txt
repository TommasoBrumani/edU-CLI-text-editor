Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.

shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends

Pris: No.

once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.

Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional

Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.

Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was

Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a

Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
